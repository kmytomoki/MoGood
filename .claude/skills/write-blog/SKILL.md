## Format Guidelines

### Recommended Structure
- **Headlines:** Use H2 for main sections, placed every 300-500 words
- **Lists:** Use bullet points for 3+ items
- **Emphasis:** Use bold sparingly for key numbers and terms
- **Paragraphs:** 3-5 lines each for mobile readability
- **Code blocks:** Use when showing actual code, keep minimal for non-technical audiences

### Content Rules
1. **Target audience:** 共働き・子育て世帯の食事管理者 (adjust technical depth accordingly)
2. **Storytelling with data:** Every claim backed by a number
3. **Failure stories are gold:** Candid failures resonate more than success stories
4. **End with a question:** Invite reader interaction
5. **Product CTAs are natural, not forced:** Weave them into the narrative

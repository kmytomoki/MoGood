## AI Content Guidelines

**Content should always reflect genuine expertise and experience.**

- Do not publish AI-generated text as-is
- Include first-hand experience and original insights in every piece
- Only write about topics the author can verify for accuracy
- Avoid high-volume automated posting (quality over quantity)
- Generate drafts with placeholders like "[add your experience here]" for CEO review

## Quality Standards (Platform-Specific Scoring)

**When creating content, follow the skill definition files and scoring criteria.**

| Platform | Skill Definition | Minimum Score |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Blog | `.claude/skills/write-blog.md` | 75 points |

### Content Creation Workflow

1. Load the skill definition file
2. Create content following scoring criteria
3. Output scoring results in table format
4. If below minimum score, improve before output

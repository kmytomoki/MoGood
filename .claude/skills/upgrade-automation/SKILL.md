## Evaluation Criteria

Rate each new feature on 5 dimensions (10 points each, 50 total):

| Dimension | What to Evaluate |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Automation impact | How much manual work does this eliminate? |
| Adoption cost | Implementation time and complexity |
| Stability | Preview/beta vs. stable release |
| System compatibility | How easily does it integrate with current AI-CEO Framework? |
| Content value | Could this become an article or book topic? |

30+ points -> Recommend adoption
20-29 points -> Consider
19 or below -> Skip

## Workflow

### Periodic Check (weekly)

```
1. Run `claude --version` to check current version
2. Compare with last checked version
3. If new features found:
   a. Research feature details
   b. Score on 5 dimensions
   c. Create adoption proposal for features scoring 30+
   d. Notify CEO
4. Record results in .company/departments/dev/upgrade-log.md
```

### Adoption Execution

```
1. After proposal is approved (or auto-approve policy applies)
2. Update existing scripts, agents, and skills
3. Run tests
4. Report completion (update STATE.md)
```
